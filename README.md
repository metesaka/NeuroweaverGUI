# NeuroweaverGUI

This project is done under supervision of Emory University BMI to support the development of open source software.

## Mentors:
I had the chance to work with an amazing team of mentors througout the project:

- [Dr. Babak Mahmoudi](https://med.emory.edu/directory/profile/?u=BMAHMO2)
- [Ozgur Kara](https://karaozgur.com/)
- [Yusen Zhu](https://bioengineering.gatech.edu/index.php/user/1588)

## Project Details:

This GUI is designed to support [Neuroweaver](https://www.brainstimjrnl.com/article/S1935-861X(21)00478-2/fulltext). 
Neuroweaver is a framework designed to operate intelligent closed-loop neuromodulation systems. It enables users to construct models and workflows using a component-flow model and to build workflow graphs. Currently, Neuroweaver users must manually code each step of the component-flow graph construction. However, its GUI simplifies this process by allowing code-independent graph building. The GUI is designed to be lightweight, modular, independent of workflow processes, and extendable.

The source code of Neuroweaver is unavailable as it is yet under development by Emory BMI. **This Repo will be updated when Neuroweaver becomes public.**

## Running the GUI
After installing the requirements, the GUI can be run using guiMain.py file. It lacks certain properties as Neuroweaver code is missing, however, it still can operate as intended to observe the use.

```
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python3 guiMain.py
```

## Demo Video
Here's the Demo of the GUI:
